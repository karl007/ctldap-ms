; This is required if a client would search for a group/user cn, which was always returned lowercase
; (as dn) but you cannot search for a lowercase CN - in my opionion this should alwasy be true with dn_lower_case

; LDAP server ip to listen on, change it to 0.0.0.0 when external access required
; When you use the iptables_port setting, the port forwarding is stil installed on the eth0 card

; This user credentials are used to authenticate against ChurchTools for API access
; The user must be granted "churchcore:administer persons" and "churchdb:view" rights for the wrapper to work properly!

; To use SSL/TLS, provide file names for x509 certificate and key here
; Use this command to create a private key and a certificate:
; openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
; Use this command to remove the encryption password:
; openssl rsa -in key.pem -out newkey.pem && mv newkey.pem key.pem

; ldap_key_filename=key.pem


; Define the sites here. For each site please enter one section.
; The section title has to be in the format sites.<ldap_base_dn>, e.g. "sites.foobar",
;   where foobar is the organisation, as in the instance foobar.church.tools .
; ldap_password_bcrypt is optional, if not specified, the default value will be taken from the config above
; dn_lower_case is optional, if not specified, the default value will be taken from the config above
; email_lower_case is optional, if not specified, the default value will be taken from the config above
; If ldap_base_dn is set above, the setting above are treated as an additional site.
